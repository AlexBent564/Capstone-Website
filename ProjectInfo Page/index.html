            Project Overview:
        </p>
        <P>
           Our project is about visualizing the process of a tree growth. Users can type in the key variables on a pretty cool interface, and
           then they can get a visualized result about the growth condition of a certain tree after a period of time.
           The original program needs user to have some knowledge about some programing language in order to run the program and get the result.
           With the help of our program, the audience of the program will be larger.
        </P>
        <p class="title1">
            Basic features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
             Develop a web application that provides a dynamic interface to the ACGCA model; 
            this could be through re-implementing the model in an internal module, or somehow
            serving as a GUI front end driven by the existing MatLab or C code in the background.
            The interface should be easy for non computer-savvy users to use and visually appealing.
            </li>
            <li>
             Allows dynamic exploration: users can easily enter parameter values (or perhaps have sliders
             allowing users to adjust them within realistic ranges) and “click GO” to re-run the model to explore
             the results. The parameters represent different biological “traits” that govern tree growth, and
             different numerical values can result in different growth patterns, and can mean the difference
             between a healthy growing tree versus one that dies quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
              The resulting model output should be shown as some simple visualization of predicted tree health
              over time, as well as being downloadable as a numerical file.  
            </li>
            <li>
                A particular set of parameter values is meant to describe an individual tree, and upon clicking “GO,”
                the model will simulate how that tree grows over a specific time period (also input by the user)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="title1">
            Further development Goal:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
             A more advanced interface should be able to simulate growth patterns for multiple trees (i.e.,
             multiple sets of parameter values).
            </li>
            <li>
             It would be useful if the user could also have the option of uploading a data file with the (30+)
             parameter values, instead of entering them using the GUI as outlined above. Users should also be
             able to “save settings”, saving a particular parameter set into a data file (e.g. XML, JSON), which
             could be mailed to and uploaded by other users to explore.
            </li>
            <li>
              An improved and more detailed visualization of tree growth/vitality; something more interesting/
              interactive than the basic visualization required in the MVP. The results should be available in a nice
              viewer, e.g., with a time slider along the bottom allowing the users to (a) “play” the time sequence so
              that the slider moves on its own through the time series, with the tree visualization changing
              accordingly; and (b) the user can move the slider manually. This could be achieved with automated
              arrangements of a series of 2-D images of a tree as well as scaling those images to create a time
              series that visualizes changes to the tree over time. During stressful periods, the tree may drop
              leaves or branches while maintaining its height, and the visualization tool should be able to capture
              these “pruning” periods.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user elects6 to simulate growth of multiple trees (different sets of parameter values), visualizing
                or plotting tools should be developed to “overlay” or compare the predicted growth patterns of the
                different trees.
            </li>
