    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
      Our project is about visualizing the process of a tree growth.
      Users can type in the key variables on a pretty cool interface, and
      then they can get a visualized result about the growth condition of a
      certain tree after a period of time. The original program needs user
      to have some knowledge about some programing language in order to run
      the program and get the result. With the help of our program, the
      audience of the program will be larger.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic Features</h2>

    <p>
      <p>
        Develop a web application that provides a dynamic interface to the ACGCA model;
        this could be through re-implementing the model in an internal module, or somehow
        serving as a GUI front end driven by the existing MatLab or C code in the background.
        The interface should be easy for non computer-savvy users to use and visually appealing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allows dynamic exploration: users can easily enter parameter values (or perhaps have sliders
        allowing users to adjust them within realistic ranges) and “click GO” to re-run the model to explore
        the results. The parameters represent different biological “traits” that govern tree growth, and
        different numerical values can result in different growth patterns, and can mean the difference
        between a healthy growing tree versus one that dies quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resulting model output should be shown as some simple visualization of predicted tree health
        over time, as well as being downloadable as a numerical file.
      </p>
      <p>
        A particular set of parameter values is meant to describe an individual tree, and upon clicking “GO,”
        the model will simulate how that tree grows over a specific time period (also input by the user)
      </p>
    </p>

    <h2>Further Development Goals</h2>

    <p>
      A more advanced interface should be able to simulate growth patterns
      for multiple trees (i.e., multiple sets of parameter values).
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be useful if the user could also have the option of uploading a
      data file with the (30+) parameter values, instead of entering them
      using the GUI as outlined above. Users should also be able to
      “save settings”, saving a particular parameter set into a data
      file (e.g. XML, JSON), which could be mailed to and uploaded by
      other users to explore.
    </p>
    <p>
      An improved and more detailed visualization of tree growth/vitality; something more interesting/
      interactive than the basic visualization required in the MVP. The results should be available in a nice
      viewer, e.g., with a time slider along the bottom allowing the users to (a) “play” the time sequence so
      that the slider moves on its own through the time series, with the tree visualization changing
      accordingly; and (b) the user can move the slider manually. This could be achieved with automated
      arrangements of a series of 2-D images of a tree as well as scaling those images to create a time
      series that visualizes changes to the tree over time. During stressful periods, the tree may drop
      leaves or branches while maintaining its height, and the visualization tool should be able to capture
      these “pruning” periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the user elects6 to simulate growth of multiple trees (different sets of parameter values), visualizing
      or plotting tools should be developed to “overlay” or compare the predicted growth patterns of the
      different trees.
