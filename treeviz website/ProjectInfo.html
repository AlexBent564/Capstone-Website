    <h1>A User-friendly Platform for Visualizing Tree Growth</h1>

    <br><h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Climate change is causing detrimental effects on plants and animals.
      Trees, which cover nearly half of all land area contribute massively
      to the exchange of carbon with the atmosphere.
      <br><br>
      To better understand how trees affect and are affected
      by climate change, Dr. Kiona Ogle of Ogle labs developed a
      program that simulates tree growth. The program is called
      the Allometrically Constrained Growth and Carbon Allocation
      (ACGCA) model.
      <br><br>
      For more information on the original project description, please
      use this link:
      <br><a href="Ogle-VizTreeGrowth.pdf">Project Description</a>
    </p>

    <br><h2>The problem..</h2>
    <p>
        is that the model requires at least some knowledge in
      programming. This severely limits the range of impact that the
      program could have in educating people about the relationship
      between tree growth and climate change.
    </p>

    <br><h2>The solution..</h2>
    <p>
        is a user-friendly graphical interface. Team TreeViz will create
        a web application that will allow users of any background to
        utilize the ACGCA model. Suddenly, Dr. Ogle's model will be
        reaching the minds of a much broader audience, helping them
        better understand how tree growth is affected by climate change.
    </p>


    <br><h2>Solution Requirements:</h2>
    <p>
      To organize development of our web application, we have separated
      it into its basic requirements.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="inner-list">An aesthetic and easy-to-naviagate graphical user interface</li>
      <li class="inner-list">A way for users to enter in any of the 30+ inputs to the model</li>
      <li class="inner-list">A visually appealing output representation of the simulated tree</li>
      <li class="inner-list">A way for users to save their inputs for later use</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies:</h2>
    <p>
      In order to fully realize our solution, we will need to use certain
      technologies.
