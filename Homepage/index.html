	<h1>TreeViz</h1>
	<h3>A user-friendly platform for visualizing tree growth</h3>
	<h3>Purpose</h3>
	<p>The purpose of this team standards document is to establish a common understanding of expectations between team members. An overview of what a typical meeting should look like is outlined.</p>
	<!-- to be filled in-->
	<h3>Problem</h3>
	<p>Though our client has already developed an model for how growth of trees are affected by environment. Because the current implementation is not particularly user friendly. To use this model, users are required to enter command line parameter and invocation of the model code. THe output is purely numerical which is obviously tough to understand. Thus our cline wants us to interface with those manual parts and attach it to a Graphical User Interface.</p>
	<h3>Solutions</h3>
	<p>This is our design for project</p>
