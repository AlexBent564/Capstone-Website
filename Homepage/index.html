	<h1>TreeViz</h1>
	<h3>A user-friendly platform for visualizing tree growth</h3>
	<h3>Purpose</h3>
	<p>The purpose of this team standards document is to establish a common understanding of expectations between team members. An overview of what a typical meeting should look like is outlined.</p>
	<!-- to be filled in-->
	<h3>Problem</h3>
	<p>Because the current implementation is not particularly user friendly; it requires command line parameter entry and invocation of the model code, and output is purely numerical.Thus the model has not been used much by other researchers or educators</p>
	<h3>Solutions</h3>
	<p>Our job is to interface with those manual parts and attach it to a Graphical User Interface.</p>
